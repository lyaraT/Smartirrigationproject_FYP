Wheat,14,169,8,19,"### 🌾 Prediction Result

**Crop Type**: Wheat  
**Crop Stage**: Germination  
**Soil Moisture (%):** 4.76  
**VPD:** 6.48  
**Prediction:** 💦 Irrigation Required  
🔒 **Confidence Score**: 69.95%

---  

🔍 Why this decision was made:

1. Most influential factor: Soil Moisture (%)
👉 Low soil moisture means roots may not get enough water.
🔹 SHAP Contribution: increased irrigation probability by +1.94

2. Second most influential factor: Crop Type
👉 Some crops require less water or are drought-tolerant.
🔹 SHAP Contribution: reduced irrigation probability by −0.72

3. Third most influential factor: Temperature (°C)
👉 Cool temperatures slow down water loss from the soil.
🔹 SHAP Contribution: reduced irrigation probability by −0.23

Note: Higher absolute SHAP values mean greater influence on the decision.",.gradio\flagged\Crop Image\d467989df29e0c98d076\image.webp,2025-08-14 16:31:06.303011
